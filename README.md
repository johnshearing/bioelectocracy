# BioElectocracy: Who Is My Neighbor?
## Human Governance Based On Morphogenesis
#### Thanks to Michael Levin, Benjamin Lyons, and many others for laying the foundation on which this project stands 

Morphogenesis, according to Levin, is the process where a single fertilized egg creates a community of cells who work collectively and intelligently to build the target organism.  
[See this video](https://youtu.be/lIHUWOv4nkE?si=1yHTiE4H1V6J58Dy&t=210)  

Lyons theorized that collective intelligence at any scale from cellular morphogenesis to Adam Smith's Invisible Hand emerges from a price system which acts as the cognitive glue causing individuals to cooperate in a way that provides the collective with emergent intelligence and competencies that no individual in the group possesses.  
[See this video](https://youtu.be/0Oo4ng6dWrQ?si=mZqxWIEKtLFKi28l&t=34)  

[Their joint paper: Cognitive Glues Are Shared Models of Relative Scarcities: The Economics of Collective Intelligence](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/3fdya)  

**BioElectocracy** imagines the collective of all humans to be one single very young organism in the process of morphogenesis.  
In other words, [imagining Adam and Eve as if they themselves are the sperm and egg](https://youtu.be/lIHUWOv4nkE?si=QDRpbyfev-ueD6Qc&t=331), such that a collective of humans has been created that continue to reproduce and to self-assemble into a single larger organism where each human is considered a single cell of this larger collective being.  
**Lets call this human collective being a macro-organism and lets call it Mac for short.**  
BioElectocracy imagines that Mac has a will (goals and desires) which are completely independent of its human membership.  
This is easier to imagine when you consider that many humans smoke cigarettes and consume sugar when both are irritating to the cells in the short term and will kill all the cells if enough is consumed in the long term.  
BioElectocracy further imagines that Mac is trying to self-assemble itself into a specific (target) life form, and that our job, as it's cells, is to help Mac navigate the obstacles in morphous-space so it may reach it's desired (target) form.  

[Lyon's price system](https://youtu.be/0Oo4ng6dWrQ?si=mZqxWIEKtLFKi28l&t=34) which tracks relative scarcity, seems to answer a lot of questions about where the controls are on any form of collective intelligence including Mac.  

This new knowledge creates a dilemma for human governance because humans are not supposed to control human collective intelligence but rather help it come to good collective decisions. Furthermore, humans are not supposed to decide the target life form that Mac is trying to achieve, but rather, we are supposed to help Mac navigate morphous-space to find itself at the target life form that Mac is trying to achieve.   

BioElectocracy asks:
1. [Levin shows where the controls are for morphogenesis in biological organisms](https://youtu.be/7vsYIlukqn0?si=ZB6S0YzmSqSlGAWS&t=36)  
2. Where are the controls on what Mac does and what Mac becomes?   
3. How are the controls used?  
4. [Levin shows an example of one organism hijacking the morphogenesis of another organism.](https://youtu.be/7vsYIlukqn0?si=mC_nYKDYxDUoFILR&t=2216)  
5. [What does it look like when another macro-organism hijacks Mac's morphogenesis?](https://x.com/MikeBenzCyber/status/1859468415070576815)  
6. Who already knows where the controls are and is already using them to control Mac's behavior and to hijack Mac's morphogenesis?   
7. How can these controls be decentralized so that no central powers can decide the target morphogenesis for the human macro-organism of which we are all a part?  
8. [Levin explains cancer in an organism and demonstrates a cure.](https://youtu.be/lIHUWOv4nkE?si=yipnr8uxzCT6ohv3&t=2761)  
9. [What does cancer look like in Mac?](https://johnshearing.github.io/unseen_creatures_which_feed_on_humans/)  
10. How can the cure for cancer which Levin has already discovered be applied to Mac's wellbeing and how can we help Mac reach its target form when no human knows what type of macro-organism Mac is trying to assemble itself into?
    * Both objectives are accomplished when everyone follows one simple rule.
    * Individual cells don't know what type of biological organism they are trying to build any more than we know what type of macro-organism we are trying to build.  
    * All the cells do is follow one simple rule, and the target organism results from the intelligence in the collective that no individual cell knows anything about. 
    * We humans do not need to know what type of macro-organism we are building any more than cells need to know what type of organism they are building.  
    * All we need to do is follow one simple rule and Mac will self-assemble into its preferred target form. 
    * This simple rule (written below) has been stated first in Jewish scripture and has been amplified by Jesus and Muhammad for clarity.
    * It may seem like two rules at first but it's just one rule given in two different ways so that we can understand it better.
    * We will be looking at this simple rule through the lens of Morphogenesis and the Price System provided by Levin and Lyons to see if this is the rule required to help Mac navigate the obstacles to reach it's preferred target state without our needing to know what that target state is.
    * > Matthew 22:36-40 King James Version, The Great Commandment
      > * Master, which is the great commandment in the law?
      > * Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy [soul](https://johnshearing.github.io/unseen_creatures_which_feed_on_humans/#What_Is_The_Soul), and with all thy mind.
      > * This is the first and great commandment.
      > * And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
      > * On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
      * This is not two great commandments, this is the one great commandment given in two different ways (And the second is like unto it)
      * It was given to us twice so that we would understand that loving the collective intelligence right next to us is how we love the greatest collective intelligence(God).
      * We love the entire collective (God) when we care for our neighbors.
      * We are told to love our neighbors **as** ourselves.
        * Not "like" ourselves but "as" ourselves - as if we can not distinguish between our neighbor's and ourselves.
        * In [The Parable Of The Good Samaritan](https://johnshearing.github.io/bible_passages_where_jesus_speaks/#Who_Is_My_Neighbor_And_What_Do_You_Mean_By_Love), Jesus brings even more clarity to The One Great Commandment. Jesus uses the word "compassion" to describe what The Good Samaritan was feeling for the injured man. The word "compassion" means to suffer with.
        * This is very similar to [what Levin describes in this video](https://youtu.be/sViUqqkuTkA?si=G5iRplqEkWeb7MIT&t=1399) where cells work together because their minds are electrically coupled together. The cells in our bodies truly cannot differentiate themselves from other cells. So when one cell is being stressed, the other cells think they are being stressed and so respond to help. Cells have true compassion for each other because they literally feel each other's pain.
        * Levin states that cells which are electrically coupled have a common identity which forces them to cooperate in achieving goals. Now think about how identity politics has been wielded by Deep State controlled media in recent elections and then consider how identity controls on collective intelligence scale from micro-organism to organism to macro-organism.  
        * This is also very similar to [what Lyons describes in his this video](https://youtu.be/0Oo4ng6dWrQ?si=hre-3jXSljHzJpKY&t=890) where humans share each other's stress via the price system and so work together to find the best solution.
        #### Who Is My Neighbor? To Whom Do I Charge Interest? Mac's Morphogenesis (Humanity's Destiny) Hangs On This Question.
          * The [The Parable Of The Good Samaritan](https://johnshearing.github.io/bible_passages_where_jesus_speaks/#Who_Is_My_Neighbor_And_What_Do_You_Mean_By_Love) gives us another important insight about identity.
          * The lawyer asks Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?" In other words, "With whom do I identify with?" or "Who is also part of my body?" or "Who's pain besides my own do I feel?"
          * The Samaritans and the Jews had much animosity towards each other and these feelings were cultivated by the Romans in order to make both peoples easier to manage.
          * But Jesus tells of a Samaritan who feels compassion for an injured Jew and makes clear that we are to feel compassion and show mercy to anyone in need without any regard for group identity.
          * In the Old Testament, God directly commands Jews not to lend at interest to poor Jews nor to any foreigners.
            > Exodus 22:25 New International Version (God is speaking to Moses)
            > * If you lend money to one of my people among you who is needy, do not treat it like a business deal; charge no interest.
            > Leviticus 25:35-37 New International Version (God is speaking to Moses)
            > * If any of your fellow Israelites become poor and are unable to support themselves among you, help them as you would a foreigner and stranger, so they can continue to live among you.
            >  * Do not take interest or any profit from them, but fear your God, so that they may continue to live among you.
            >  * You must not lend them money at interest or sell them food at a profit.
          * #### Contrary to what God has instructed Moses to say, Moses allowed Jews to lend at interest to foreigners (Non-Jews) and forbad lending to any Jew.
            > Deuteronomy 23:19-20 King James Version (Moses is speaking to his people, the Jews)
            > * Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury:
            > * Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury: that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to possess it.
          * Lending at interests is arguably the greatest cause of human suffering and the cause (identity) fits Levin's definition of cancer at the scale of macro-organism.
             * The Central Banks
               * [All Wars Are Bankers' Wars: Search X for 43 minute video](https://x.com/search?q=all%20wars%20are%20bankers%20wars&src=typed_query)
               * [All Wars Are Bankers' Wars: Search Rumble for 43 minute video](https://rumble.com/search/all?q=%22all%20wars%20are%20bankers%20wars%22)          
               * [All Wars Are Bankers' Wars: Watch 43 minute video on YouTube if not deleted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrKf9nYeXT0)
               * [All Wars Are Bankers' Wars: Read as a webpage](https://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/allwarsarebankerwars.php)
               * [All Wars Are Bankers' Wars: Read as a PDF](https://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/allwarsarebankerswars.pdf)
               * [The Creature From Jekyll Island: Read as a PDF on Internet Archive](https://ia904500.us.archive.org/17/items/pdfy--Pori1NL6fKm2SnY/The%20Creature%20From%20Jekyll%20Island.pdf)
             * Levin shows that the underlying cause of cancer is identity.
             * The Cancer of usury would be completely forbidden in Jewish law if Moses had felt the same sense of identity with all people that he felt for his own people (the Jewish people). 
             * So there is a clear link between cancer at the scale of macro-organism and group identity.
          * Jesus and Muhammad both warned against usury and it is completely forbidden under Islamic law.           

#### Below are notes and links which will be woven into the narative started above. 
I have no idea where this is all going.  
The following proverb will be my guide.  
> Proverbs 3:5-6 King James Version  
> * Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.
> * In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.
  * The above indicates that the intelligence, the competencies, and the plan are stored in the collective intelligence rather than in the individual and that the individual is to trust in the collective intelligence.
  * We are **not** being told to trust the collective intelligence which is Mac, but rather the collective intelligence that sits at the very top - the one made from all the smaller collective intelligences. This is God.
  * Many will ask how one can know what path God is asking us to follow. That's easy - it's the choice that feels most like love and kindness during prayer and meditation when the mind is quiet. If none of your choices feel loving or kind then your mind is not quite enough. God will never send you a thought that doesn't feel loving and kind. Sit longer until your mind is quiet enough to hear what God is saying to you. 

> Luke 11:1-4 King James Version
> * And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.
> * And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.
> * Give us day by day our daily bread.
> * And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.


It has been said that information is a difference that makes a difference.  
In other words a change in one structure (A) causes a change in some other structure (B).  
Structure (B) must notice that structure (A) has changed, so a small transfer of energy from (A) To (B) must be required to move information but that is not all that is required.  
Stucture (B) must already be set to change its state as a result of the energy received by stucture (A).  
It might be said that structure (B) must be listening for, or at least be receptive to changes is structure (A).   
It's a relationship. There must be a relationship in place in order for information to be passed from (A) to (B).  
A line of dominos must be standing in order for the falling of domino (A) to affect the state of domino (B).  
So it might be said that domino (B) when standing, is listening, or watching for a change in domino (A).  
Perhaps it would be better to say that there is a relationship between domino (A) and domino (B) only when both are standing.  
Whether or not information is passed from domino (A) to (B) depends on a relationship already being in place between the two.  
If domino (B) is already laying down when domino (A) falls upon it then energy is being passed between the two but no information that we are interested in is passed.  
If domino (B) is standing when domino (A) falls upon it then both energy and information is passed because the state of domino (B) will change from standing to laying down.  
So underlying the passage of all information is relatioinship.  

Only a small change in the voltage on the base terminal of a transitor creates a large change in the amount of current flowing between the collector and emitter terminals.

[The instructions for morphogenesis are not in the genes.](https://youtu.be/whZRH7IGAq0?si=XK6hkvzAPQ-dS9lL&t=1771)

What type of attractor is human governance?  
point attractors (a single stable point), limit cycle attractors (periodic oscillations), and strange attractors (complex, chaotic patterns) 

All intelligence is collective intelligence.  
The sensation of feeling that I experience in my finger tips, for instance, is not a direct experience, but rather virtual experience assembled from many signals starting a with the cells in my fingers and then relayed along by other cells to the brain cells that process the signals to produce a result which my collective self (me) perceive as sensation in the finger tips. My collective self (me) and therefore all my experience is not physical, but rather just signals passing between my parts (the cells) which causes all the cells, as a collective (me), to respond in some way. That the group of cells (I) am conscious at all is simply because some of my cells retain a relational memory of these events. What is this price system and how do my cells make use of it to create me?

information is a living think. Levin says "Thoughts are thinkers."

About The Trinity 
Father - The mind. Infinite intelligence and love. Nonphysical. Made from the information exchanged in the universe.
Son - thats us, The body. The sensation. The raw input.
Holy Spirit, Our relationship. The nervous system. That which causes us to love The Father and which causes The Father to love us.

I am realizing that the human super-organism is using groups of humans to form organs such that humans are locked into performing a single function and have little or no capacity to change their lives or even move from their geographic location.
This is good for a few but not so good for others.
It's a lot like the cells in the body speciallizing. 
Is this what Mac wants or is Mac's morphogenesis being hijacked?

For instance Michael Levin shows that cancer occurs when a cell or group of cells loses the ability to communicate with neighbors (blocked ion channels). The cells then act like a single cell organisms rather than community members and so feed upon neighbors. This same kind of cancer seems to happen at the level of human society as well. When communication is blocked between communities, or when communities identify as different than other communities then they will all stop cooperating and start to feed upon the others. Benjamin Lyons makes this comparison intuitively accessible to us by asking to imagine why we react to stubbing our toe with greater concern than the death of a large group of people seen on a news cast. The fact that we can feel the pain of a stubbed toe, but the best we can do is imagine the suffering of people shown in a news cast. The toe is part of the self because it can share it's stress directly with the rest of our body where as the dying and injured on the news have no such direct connection with which to share their stress. 

Bioelectricity explains how an oak gall wasp can hack the bioelectric network in the leaf of an oak tree, hijacking its morphogenesis such that the leaf to grows into a gall which becomes a home for the wasp's offspring. 
I think we see the central banks, corporations, and supporting industrial complexes hacking humanity's morphogenesis. 
The body of work raises the question of what exactly is the target of morphogenesis for the human collective if allowed to develop without being hacked. 
Finally, I am wondering if it is possible to hardcode "Love thy neighbor as thyself" into a governance system as it appears to happen in bioelectric networks.  

[Video: Why Democracy Is Mathematically Impossible](https://youtu.be/qf7ws2DF-zk?si=brxyoh59HRFQK3Nf)  
The video pointed out that our current forms of democracy all resolve mathematically to dictatorship except for a rated voting system which can represent a democracy in the case of voting for a leader.
I picked out two false premises in the video.
1. That a voting system which leads to best collective decision must have [these 5 qualities]((https://youtu.be/qf7ws2DF-zk?si=MFM6N08a6Rbcnp0m&t=843):
[Bees collective decision making process](https://github.com/johnshearing/beemocracy/blob/main/BeemocracyMina.md) does not share these qualities.
Bees have a form of democracy which closely resembles governance by random juries which was not discussed in the video.
This governance has been a stable and reliable way to produce the best decisions for the last million years.
2. [That elections should be rational](https://youtu.be/qf7ws2DF-zk?si=51knDhw2CCuxmx2X&t=3):
Game Theory only predicts an outcome if all actors in the game are rational and act in their own best interest.
So if actors are rational then you can predict with certainty what they will do.
If you can predict what your opponent will do then you have enough information to game the system and produce any outcome you want.
Therefore a functional voting system must be irrational, unpredictable, and non-deterministic.
[Beemocracy](https://github.com/johnshearing/beemocracy/blob/main/BeemocracyMina.md) has these qualities.
Perhaps this is exactly why United States policy seems so crazy.
Leaders must appear irrational (insane) in order to obscure their preferences, self-interest, and rationality.
This is so other leaders will have a more difficult time predicting their actions using Game Theory maths.
Of course other nations with their own game theorists ignore the show and also create their own show of insanity in order to prevent being gamed.

Been wondering about the inteligence in evolution.  
Where does it come from.  
We marvel at the intelligence of a single cell as it navigates morphous space to reach it's target form.  
What if what we view as the evolution of man is really just morphegenesis of the human super-organism as it grows to it's target form.  

Still, where is the target form image (the blueprint) that the human super-organism is reading?  
What is the target form that the human super-organsim is trying to reach?
Is it all just guided by aggrigated preference?
Are other super-organisms (Central Banks) hacking our collective morphogenesis?

Compare this [Abraham Hicks cartoon](https://youtu.be/Nb5yL7vkV9k?si=9wy7kgQxXMwLoBup&t=21) with Benjamin Lyon's ideas about cognitive glue.  

Do cells war with each other during morphogenesis? If not, why do countries war?  

It will be an interesting and fun challenge to ask these questions, communicate these ideas, and tell this story.
