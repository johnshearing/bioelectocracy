# bioelectocracy
This is a placeholder for work on human governance and collective decision making based on Michael Levin's work with bioelectricity and neural cellular automata.  
Writing and software development will start after a short period of orientation.  
The first document will be a running list of learning resources for bioelectricity and neural cellular automata so others can more easily get started.  
Next will be a description of the voting and governance software which is likely to run on the Mina recursive zero knowledge proof blockchain.  
Then a small experimental implementation will be developed.  

Bioelectricity and neural cellular automata seem to answer a lot of questions about how we can improve human collective decision making and governance.  
For instance Michael Levin shows that cancer is when a cell or group of cells loses its ability to identify with its neighbors. The cell then acts like a single cell organism which seeks only to feed and reproduce. This same kind of cancer seems to happen at the human level too. Bioelectricity explains how a wasp can hack the bioelectric network of an oak tree. I think we see the central banks, corporations, and supporting industrial complexes hacking humanity's morphogenesis. The body or work raises the question of what exactly is the target of morphogenesis for the human collective if allowed to develop without being hacked. Finally, I am wondering if it is possible to hardcode "Love thy neighbor as thyself" into a governance system as it appears to happen in bioelectric networks.
