Collective intelligence, collective decision making, and human governance based Michael Levin and Benjamin Lyons' work theorizing that collective intelligence at any scale from cellular morphogenesis to Adam Smith's invisible hand can all be mapped onto a price system which acts as the cognitive glue that causes individuals to cooperate and which provides the collective with emergent intelligence and competencies that no individual in the group possesses alone. This price system which tracks relative scarcity seem to answer a lot of questions about how we can improve human collective decision making and governance.  

For instance Michael Levin shows that cancer occurs when a cell or group of cells loses the ability to communicate with neighbors (blocked ion channels). The cells then act like a single cell organisms rather than community members and so feed upon neighbors. This same kind of cancer seems to happen at the level of human society as well. When communication is blocked between communities, or when communities identify as different than other communities then they will all stop cooperating and start to feed upon the others. Benjamin Lyons makes this comparison intuitively accessible to us by asking to imagine why we react to stubbing our toe with greater concern than the death of a large group of people seen on a news cast. The fact that we can feel the pain of a stubbed toe, but the best we can do is imagine the suffering of people shown in a news cast. The toe is part of the self because it can share it's stress directly with the rest of our body where as the dying and injured on the news have no such direct connection with which to share their stress.

I am realizing that the human super-organism¬†is using groups of humans to form organs such that humans are locked into performing a single function and have little or no capacity to change their lives or even move from their geographic location. It's a lot like the cells in the body.¬†

Bioelectricity explains how an oak gall wasp can hack the bioelectric network in the leaf of an oak tree, hijacking its morphogenesis such that the leaf to grows into a gall which becomes a home for the wasp's offspring. 
I think we see the central banks, corporations, and supporting industrial complexes hacking humanity's morphogenesis. 
The body of work raises the question of what exactly is the target of morphogenesis for the human collective if allowed to develop without being hacked. 
Finally, I am wondering if it is possible to hardcode "Love thy neighbor as thyself" into a governance system as it appears to happen in bioelectric networks.

Wow! That was very much worth watching!
It pointed out that our current forms of democracy all resolve mathematically to dictatorship.
But it pointed out that a rated voting system can actually represent democracy in the case of voting for a leader.
https://youtu.be/qf7ws2DF-zk?si=brxyoh59HRFQK3Nf&t=1142

I picked out two false premises in the video.

That a voting system which leads to best collective decision must have these 5 qualities:
https://youtu.be/qf7ws2DF-zk?si=MFM6N08a6Rbcnp0m&t=843
Bees collective decision making process does not share these qualities.
Bees have a form of democracy which closely resembles governance by random juries which was not discussed in the video.
This governance has been a stable and reliable way to produce the best decisions for the last million years.
That elections should be rational:
https://youtu.be/qf7ws2DF-zk?si=51knDhw2CCuxmx2X&t=3
Game Theory only predicts an outcome if all actors in the game are rational and act in their own best interest.
So if actors are rational then you can predict with certainty what they will do.
If you can predict what the crowd will do then you have enough information to game the system and produce any outcome you want.
Therefore a functional voting system must be irrational, unpredictable, and non-deterministic.
Beemocracy has these qualities.üêù
Not for nothing this is exactly why United States policy seems so crazy.
Leaders must appear irrational (insane) in order to obscure their preferences, self-interest, and rationality.
This is so other leaders will have a more difficult time predicting their actions using Game Theory maths.
Of course other nations with their own game theorists ignore the show and also create their own show of insanity in order to prevent being gamed.

Been wondering about the inteligence in evolution.  
Where does it come from.  
We marvel at the intelligence of a single cell as it navigates morphous space to reach it's target form.  
What if what we view as the evolution of man is really just morphegenesis of the human super-organism as it grows to it's target form.  

Still, where is the target form image (the blueprint) that the human super-organism is reading?  
What is the target form that the human super-organsim is trying to reach?
Are 
Is the target form try
Is it all just guided by aggrigated preference?
Are other super-organisms hacking our collective morphogenesis?


So far I have the following index of papers by Benjamin Lyons:

https://osf.io/preprints/osf/3fdya

I feel like these show where the controls are for human collective intelligence.
This makes an interesting dilemma for governance because we are not supposed to control the intelligence but rather help it come to good collective decisions.

BioElectocracy will attempt to address:
What is the morphogenesis target of the human super organism?
In other words, imagine if each one of us is a cell in a larger organism.
In that case, what type of animal is the human collective trying to become?
Where are the controls for morphogenesis of the human super organism,
Who knows where the controls are and is using them now to control the morphogenesis of the human super organism?
How to protect the humanity's development from being hijacked and turned it to something other than what it is trying to become?
Once the target is known, how can we support its development so as to reach its natural target form without defects introduced by central powers?
In other words, how can we help deliver this baby without defects?

In [The One Great Commandment - Matthew 22:36-40 King James Version](https://johnshearing.github.io/bible_passages_where_jesus_speaks/index.html#The_One_Great_Commandment) we are told to love God and love thy neighbor as thyself as if these are both one and the same thing. Not "like yourself" but rather "as yourself". As if there is no way to discern the difference. The Latin word for compassion means "to suffer with and "compassion" is the word used in [The Parable of The Good Samaritan - Luke 10:25-37 King James Version](https://johnshearing.github.io/bible_passages_where_jesus_speaks/index.html#Who_Is_My_Neighbor_And_What_Do_You_Mean_By_Love) where we learn what Jesus means when he uses the word "love" and defines the scope of the word "neighbor". I wonder if this can be interpeted as stress sharing, the cognative glue that Levin and Lyons demonstrate. It should also be noted that compassion is exploited by the codependent and is also used to radicalize a population as we have seen in the Effective Altruism movement. So what is healthy compassion with respect to cognative glue?

It will be an interesting and fun challenge to communicate these ideas and tell this story.
