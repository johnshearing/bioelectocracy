# bioelectocracy
This is a placeholder for work on human governance and collective decision making based on Michael Levin's work with bioelectricity and neural cellular automata.
Bioelectricity and neural cellular automata seem to answer a lot of questions about how we can improve human collective decision making and governance.  

For instance Michael Levin shows that cancer occurs when a cell or group of cells loses the ability to communicate with neighbors (blocked ion channels).
The cells then act like a single cell organisms rather than community members and so feed upon neighbors. 
This same kind of cancer seems to happen at the level of human society as well.
When communication is blocked between communities, or when communities identify as different than other communities then they will all stop cooperating and start to feed upon the others.

Bioelectricity explains how an oak gall wasp can hack the bioelectric network in the leaf of an oak tree, hijacking its morphogenesis such that the leaf to grows into a gall which becomes a home for the wasp's offspring. 
I think we see the central banks, corporations, and supporting industrial complexes hacking humanity's morphogenesis. 
The body or work raises the question of what exactly is the target of morphogenesis for the human collective if allowed to develop without being hacked. 
Finally, I am wondering if it is possible to hardcode "Love thy neighbor as thyself" into a governance system as it appears to happen in bioelectric networks.

Wow! That was very much worth watching!
It pointed out that our current forms of democracy all resolve mathematically to dictatorship.
But it pointed out that a rated voting system can actually represent democracy in the case of voting for a leader.

I picked out two false premises in the video.

That a voting system which leads to best collective decision must have these 5 qualities:
https://youtu.be/qf7ws2DF-zk?si=MFM6N08a6Rbcnp0m&t=843
Bees collective decision making process does not share these qualities.
Bees have a form of democracy which closely resembles governance by random juries which was not discussed in the video.
This governance has been a stable and reliable way to produce the best decisions for the last million years.
That elections should be rational:

Game Theory only predicts an outcome if all actors in the game are rational and act in their own best interest.
So if actors are rational then you can predict with certainty what they will do.
If you can predict what the crowd will do then you have enough information to game the system and produce any outcome you want.
Therefore a functional voting system must be irrational, unpredictable, and non-deterministic.
Beemocracy has these qualities.üêù
Not for nothing this is exactly why United States policy seems so crazy.
Leaders must appear irrational (insane) in order to obscure their preferences, self-interest, and rationality.
This is so other leaders will have a more difficult time predicting their actions using Game Theory maths.
Of course other nations with their own game theorists ignore the show and also create their own show of insanity in order to prevent being gamed.


Been wondering about the inteligence in evolution.  
Where does it come from.  
Marvel at the intelligence of a single cell to navigate morphous space to reach it's target form.  
What if what we view as the evolution of man is really just morphegenesis of the human super-organism as it grows to it's target form.  

Still, where is the target form image (the blueprint) that the human super-organism is reading?  
Is it all just guided by aggrigated preference?
Are other super-organisms hacking our collective morphogenesis?
