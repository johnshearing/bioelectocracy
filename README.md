# BioElectocracy
#### Collective Intelligence and Human Governance based Michael Levin and Benjamin Lyons' Work.  

[Morphogenesis according to Levin](https://youtu.be/lIHUWOv4nkE?si=1yHTiE4H1V6J58Dy&t=210) is the intelligent process where a single fertilized egg creates a community of cells who work collectively to navigate the building process to arive at the target organism.  

[Levin and Lyons theorize](https://youtu.be/0Oo4ng6dWrQ?si=mZqxWIEKtLFKi28l&t=34) that collective intelligence at any scale from cellular morphogenesis to Adam Smith's Invisible Hand emerge from a price system which acts as the cognitive glue causing individuals to cooperate in a way that provides the collective with emergent intelligence and competencies that no individual in the group possesses alone.  

BioElectocracy imagines the collective of all humans to be one single very young organism in the process of morphogenesis.  
In other words, [imagining Adam and Eve as the sperm and egg](https://youtu.be/lIHUWOv4nkE?si=QDRpbyfev-ueD6Qc&t=331), where a collective of humans is created that continue to reproduce and to assemble as a super-organism where each human is considered a single cell of this collective.  
Lets call this a Macro-organism and lets call it Mac for short.  
BioElectocracy imagines that Mac has a will (goals and desires) which are completely independent of it's human membership.
BioElectocracy further imagines that Mac is trying assemble itself into a specific (target) life form, and that our job is to help Mac navigate the obstacles.  

[Lyon's price system](https://youtu.be/0Oo4ng6dWrQ?si=mZqxWIEKtLFKi28l&t=34) which tracks relative scarcity, seems to answer a lot of questions about where the controls are on any form of collective intelligence including Mac.  
This new knowledge creates a dilemma for human governance because humans are not supposed to control human collective intelligence but rather help it come to good collective decisions.  
Furthermore, humans are not supposed to decide the target life form that Mac is trying to achieve but rather to help it navigate morphogenisis space to find itself at the target life form that it is trying to achieve.   

BioElectocracy asks:
1. [Levin shows where the controls are for morphogenesis in biological organisms](https://youtu.be/7vsYIlukqn0?si=ZB6S0YzmSqSlGAWS&t=36)
2. Where are the controls on what Mac does and what Mac becomes?  
3. How are the controls used?
4. [Levin shows an example of one organism hijacking the morphogenesis of another organsism.](https://youtu.be/7vsYIlukqn0?si=mC_nYKDYxDUoFILR&t=2216)
5. [What does it look like when another macro-organism hijacks Mac's morphogenesis?](https://x.com/MikeBenzCyber/status/1859468415070576815)
6. Who already knows where the controls are and is already using them to control Mac's behavior and to hijack Mac's morphogenesis?  
7. How can these controls be decentralized so that no central powers can decide the target morphogenesis for the human super-organism of which we are all a part?
8. [Levin explains cancer in an organism and demonstrates a cure.](https://youtu.be/lIHUWOv4nkE?si=yipnr8uxzCT6ohv3&t=2761)
10. [What does cancer look like in Mac?](https://johnshearing.github.io/unseen_creatures_which_feed_on_humans/)  
11. How can the cure for cancer which Levin has already discovered be applied to Mac's wellbeing?  


#### Below are notes and links which will be woven into the narative started above.  
I have no idea where this is all going. Can't wait to find out.  
Proverbs 3:5-6 King James Version  
5 Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.  
6 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.  


It has been said that information is a difference that makes a difference.  
In other words a change in one structure (A) causes a change in some other structure (B).  
Structure (B) must notice that structure (A) has changed, so a small transfer of energy from (A) To (B) must be required to move information but that is not all that is required.  
Stucture (B) must already be set to change its state as a result of the energy received by stucture (A).  
It might be said that structure (B) must be listening for, or at least be receptive to changes is structure (A).   
It's a relationship. There must be a relationship in place in order for information to be passed from (A) to (B).  
A line of dominos must be standing in order for the falling of domino (A) to affect the state of domino (B).  
So it might be said that domino (B) when standing, is listening, or watching for a change in domino (A).  
Perhaps it would be better to say that there is a relationship between domino (A) and domino (B) only when both are standing.  
Whether or not information is passed from domino (A) to (B) depends on a relationship already being in place between the two.  
If domino (B) is already laying down when domino (A) falls upon it then energy is being passed between the two but no information that we are interested in is passed.  
If domino (B) is standing when domino (A) falls upon it then both energy and information is passed because the state of domino (B) will change from standing to laying down.  
So underlying the passage of all information is relatioinship.  

Only a small change in the voltage on the base terminal of a transitor creates a large change in the amount of current flowing between the collector and emitter terminals.

[The instructions for morphogenesis are not in the genes.](https://youtu.be/whZRH7IGAq0?si=XK6hkvzAPQ-dS9lL&t=1771)

All intelligence is collective intelligence.  
The sensation of feeling that I experience in my finger tips, for instance, is not a direct experience, but rather virtual experience assembled from many signals starting a with the cells in my fingers and then relayed along by other cells to the brain cells that process the signals to produce a result which my collective self (me) perceive as sensation in the finger tips. My collective self (me) and therefore all my experience is not physical, but rather just signals passing between my parts (the cells) which causes all the cells, as a collective (me), to respond in some way. That the group of cells (I) am conscious at all is simply because some of my cells retain a relational memory of these events. What is this price system and how do my cells make use of it to create me?

information is living. About the trinity Father - infinite intelligence and love, Son - thats us, Holy Spirit, Our relationship

I am realizing that the human super-organism is using groups of humans to form organs such that humans are locked into performing a single function and have little or no capacity to change their lives or even move from their geographic location.
This is good for a few but not so good for others.
It's a lot like the cells in the body speciallizing. 
Is this what Mac wants or is Mac's morphogenesis being hijacked?

For instance Michael Levin shows that cancer occurs when a cell or group of cells loses the ability to communicate with neighbors (blocked ion channels). The cells then act like a single cell organisms rather than community members and so feed upon neighbors. This same kind of cancer seems to happen at the level of human society as well. When communication is blocked between communities, or when communities identify as different than other communities then they will all stop cooperating and start to feed upon the others. Benjamin Lyons makes this comparison intuitively accessible to us by asking to imagine why we react to stubbing our toe with greater concern than the death of a large group of people seen on a news cast. The fact that we can feel the pain of a stubbed toe, but the best we can do is imagine the suffering of people shown in a news cast. The toe is part of the self because it can share it's stress directly with the rest of our body where as the dying and injured on the news have no such direct connection with which to share their stress. 

Bioelectricity explains how an oak gall wasp can hack the bioelectric network in the leaf of an oak tree, hijacking its morphogenesis such that the leaf to grows into a gall which becomes a home for the wasp's offspring. 
I think we see the central banks, corporations, and supporting industrial complexes hacking humanity's morphogenesis. 
The body of work raises the question of what exactly is the target of morphogenesis for the human collective if allowed to develop without being hacked. 
Finally, I am wondering if it is possible to hardcode "Love thy neighbor as thyself" into a governance system as it appears to happen in bioelectric networks.  

[Video: Why Democracy Is Mathematically Impossible](https://youtu.be/qf7ws2DF-zk?si=brxyoh59HRFQK3Nf)  
The video pointed out that our current forms of democracy all resolve mathematically to dictatorship except for a rated voting system which can represent a democracy in the case of voting for a leader.
I picked out two false premises in the video.
1. That a voting system which leads to best collective decision must have [these 5 qualities]((https://youtu.be/qf7ws2DF-zk?si=MFM6N08a6Rbcnp0m&t=843):
[Bees collective decision making process](https://github.com/johnshearing/beemocracy/blob/main/BeemocracyMina.md) does not share these qualities.
Bees have a form of democracy which closely resembles governance by random juries which was not discussed in the video.
This governance has been a stable and reliable way to produce the best decisions for the last million years.
2. [That elections should be rational](https://youtu.be/qf7ws2DF-zk?si=51knDhw2CCuxmx2X&t=3):
Game Theory only predicts an outcome if all actors in the game are rational and act in their own best interest.
So if actors are rational then you can predict with certainty what they will do.
If you can predict what your opponent will do then you have enough information to game the system and produce any outcome you want.
Therefore a functional voting system must be irrational, unpredictable, and non-deterministic.
[Beemocracy](https://github.com/johnshearing/beemocracy/blob/main/BeemocracyMina.md) has these qualities.
Perhaps this is exactly why United States policy seems so crazy.
Leaders must appear irrational (insane) in order to obscure their preferences, self-interest, and rationality.
This is so other leaders will have a more difficult time predicting their actions using Game Theory maths.
Of course other nations with their own game theorists ignore the show and also create their own show of insanity in order to prevent being gamed.

Been wondering about the inteligence in evolution.  
Where does it come from.  
We marvel at the intelligence of a single cell as it navigates morphous space to reach it's target form.  
What if what we view as the evolution of man is really just morphegenesis of the human super-organism as it grows to it's target form.  

Still, where is the target form image (the blueprint) that the human super-organism is reading?  
What is the target form that the human super-organsim is trying to reach?
Are 
Is the target form try
Is it all just guided by aggrigated preference?
Are other super-organisms hacking our collective morphogenesis?

I feel like these show where the controls are for human collective intelligence.
This makes an interesting dilemma for governance because we are not supposed to control the intelligence but rather help it come to good collective decisions.

BioElectocracy will attempt to address:
What is the morphogenesis target of the human super organism?
In other words, imagine if each one of us is a cell in a larger organism.
In that case, what type of animal is the human collective trying to become?
Where are the controls for morphogenesis of the human super organism,
Who knows where the controls are and is using them now to control the morphogenesis of the human super organism?
How to protect the humanity's development from being hijacked and turned it to something other than what it is trying to become?
Once the target is known, how can we support its development so as to reach its natural target form without defects introduced by central powers?
In other words, how can we help deliver this baby without defects?

In [The One Great Commandment - Matthew 22:36-40 King James Version](https://johnshearing.github.io/bible_passages_where_jesus_speaks/index.html#The_One_Great_Commandment) we are told to love God and love thy neighbor as thyself as if these are both one and the same thing. Not "like yourself" but rather "as yourself". As if there is no way to discern the difference. The Latin word for compassion means "to suffer with and "compassion" is the word used in [The Parable of The Good Samaritan - Luke 10:25-37 King James Version](https://johnshearing.github.io/bible_passages_where_jesus_speaks/index.html#Who_Is_My_Neighbor_And_What_Do_You_Mean_By_Love) where we learn what Jesus means when he uses the word "love" and defines the scope of the word "neighbor". I wonder if this can be interpeted as stress sharing, the cognative glue that Levin and Lyons demonstrate. It should also be noted that compassion is exploited by the codependent and is also used to radicalize a population as we have seen in the Effective Altruism movement. So what is healthy compassion with respect to cognative glue?

Compare this [Abraham Hicks cartoon](https://youtu.be/Nb5yL7vkV9k?si=9wy7kgQxXMwLoBup&t=21) with Benjamin Lyon's ideas about cognitive glue.  

Do cells war with each other during morphogenesis? If not, why do countries war?  

It will be an interesting and fun challenge to ask these questions, communicate these ideas, and tell this story.
