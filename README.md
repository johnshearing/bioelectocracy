## Abstract  
**BioElectocracy** sees the collective of all humans to be one single very young organism in the process of morphogenesis. In other words, we consider the first humans as sperm and egg, and all of us as the resulting cells which continue to multiply and self-assemble into a single larger organism. **Let's call this human collective being a macro-organism and let's call it Mac for short.**  
[Levin talks about intelligence that scales](https://youtu.be/YnObwxJZpZc?si=4rsnMKImAAbTMcCR&t=1454). 

We consider Mac a conscious being with a will (preferences and goals) which are completely independent of its human membership. This is easier to imagine when you consider that we humans can run a long race while our cells are begging for rest.  
[Levin discusses the how the whole can have a different agenda than its parts](https://youtu.be/YnObwxJZpZc?si=pSK9doZOSdlpWoAX&t=1153).  

If our cells could think and speak they would likely consider the entire body as their country in a larger geopolitical world, and they would likely think of Mac as their governance or collective decision making process. But at our scale of consciousness, we see ourselves not as governance, but as living beings with thoughts and feelings. Moreover, evolution has given us a love for our own bodies which resolves to a love for our own cells. We view Mac like that consciousness and see ourselves as the cells of Mac's body. There is reason to think Mac has been created via evolution to care for us in the same way that we were created via evolution to care for the cells of our own bodies.  
[This short story](https://johnshearing.github.io/where_is_john/index.html) contemplates our own consciousness which doesn't exist at any specific location in our brain or body.  

We further consider that Mac is trying to self-assemble into a specific (target) life form. As we see from [Lyons' presentation](https://youtu.be/0Oo4ng6dWrQ?si=mZqxWIEKtLFKi28l&t=34), the price system (Mac's cognitive glue) drives Mac to make the best possible living situation for all of us according to our individual preferences. That's the form that Mac is trying to achieve. Our job, as Mac's cells, is to help Mac navigate the obstacles in morphous-space so it may reach its desired form. As we will see, humans do not need to know what target life form Mac is trying to reach in order to help it get there. Consider that the few cells which start our own journey from fertilized egg to mature human do not have any idea what they are trying to make. The blueprint for making a human is not in the genome. The genome is only a recipe book for making all our proteins but it contains no information about what organs are to be made or where they will be placed. Some of the information to make a human is defined by the few simple things that cells can do. The rest of the information is stored in the structure created by the relationships between the cells.  
[Levin uses Conway's Game of Life to show us where the information for morphogenesis is stored](https://youtu.be/whZRH7IGAq0?si=-k3-gzROJq8BpVbO&t=1765)  

In the same way, humans do not need to know what form Mac is trying to assemble itself into in order to help Mac reach it's target form. Some of the information required to build Mac is stored in our competencies (the things we are able to do). The rest of Mac's blueprint is stored in our relationship with others and with the environment. These relationships are what cause us to select which of our competencies to use. So our relationships determine how Mac gets built. The blueprint for Mac is in our relationships with others. So now we can see why the question of "Who is my neighbor?" matters so much. As we shall see, we humans just need to follow one simple relationship rule in order to help Mac reach its target form. It's the same rule that our cells follow in morphogenesis and the rule can be enforced through the price system itself. We will reveal the rule as we proceed, but you may have already guessed what it is. If not, then here are some more clues:  

Humans cannot both control Mac's thinking and still expect Mac to function as the collective intelligence which figures out how to become the best environment for us according to our own preferences. If [the price system is Mac's cognitive glue](https://youtu.be/0Oo4ng6dWrQ?si=mZqxWIEKtLFKi28l&t=34) then minds, markets, and money must be completely free of manipulation if Mac is to think correctly and arrive at its target form in morphous-space. Collectively, we need to recognize that Mac (our price system) is a living being that needs good information and complete autonomy if it is to make good decisions about what is the best environment for us.  

Currently, the price system (Mac) is controlled by a cooperative of industries including the central banks, weapons, energy, food, medicine, news media, education, State Department, Department of Defense, CIA, FBI, Department Of Justice, Prisons, Drug Cartels, Prostitution and Blackmail Industry, and The Entertainment Industry. All of these together are referred to as the Blob according to Mike Benz. The Blob is a collective intelligence as is Mac, but their scope of neighbor is quite different.   


Before we reveal the one relationship rule that humans need to agree on, and that the price system needs to enforce, we provide some more background on Levin and Lyons' work.

## How Cognition Scales
Morphogenesis, according to Levin, is the process where a single fertilized egg creates a community of cells who work collectively and intelligently to build the target organism.  
[See this video on Morphogenesis](https://youtu.be/lIHUWOv4nkE?si=1yHTiE4H1V6J58Dy&t=210)  

## Unmanipulated Price Systems Seek Preferred Conditions For All Individuals
Lyons theorized that collective intelligence at any scale from cellular morphogenesis to Adam Smith's Invisible Hand emerges from a price system which acts as the cognitive glue causing individuals to cooperate in a way that provides the collective with emergent intelligence and competencies that no individual in the group possesses.  
[See this video: The Price System As Cognitive Glue](https://youtu.be/0Oo4ng6dWrQ?si=mZqxWIEKtLFKi28l&t=34)  

[Levin's and Lyons' joint paper: Cognitive Glues Are Shared Models of Relative Scarcities: The Economics of Collective Intelligence](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/3fdya)  


## War, Scarcity, Fear, Mistrust, Division, Disunity, And Isolation Via Price System Manipulation: The Central Bank Business Model  
[Lyons' price system](https://youtu.be/0Oo4ng6dWrQ?si=mZqxWIEKtLFKi28l&t=34) which tracks relative scarcity, seems to answer a lot of questions about where the controls are on any form of collective intelligence including Mac.  

**This new knowledge creates a dilemma for human governance:
Humans cannot both control Mac's thinking and still expect Mac to function as a collective intelligence. From the viewpoint of neural networks, humans provide Mac's sensory input and the weights in the form of preference. We cannot also participate in Mac's programming if we expect Mac to produce good answers about what is best for its own body which also happens to be our home.**  

BioElectocracy asserts:  
1. If the price system is Mac's cognitive glue then minds, markets, and money must be completely free of manipulation if Mac is to think correctly and arrive at its target form in morphous-space.  
   * **All of the following manipulations cause birth defects in Mac:** Taxes, price controls, fiat money, printing currency, creating money supply shortages or gluts, manipulating interest rates, manipulating lending policy, usury in general, tariffs, sanctions, creating supply shortages or supply gluts, creating artificial demand with provocative advertising, unfavorable regulations to target a competing industry (e.g. SEC and Central Banks crushing crypto industry with regulation), giving corporations the same rights as humans, cultivating identity politics to prevent a united population, staging riots, social media censorship of non-state narratives, state controlled media, state controlled education, state controlled scientific research, state controlled a.i., state controlled search engines, creating crises both real and imagined (e.g. pandemics, climate change), sabotage to close markets (e.g. Nord Stream), false flag events to justify wars, using wars to seize land and assets and to close markets, using war to create artificial markets, using wars to launder money, using wars to force nations into debt,  flooding a city with drugs to crash market prices and to put the local population in prison, using drug money to finance covert operations and regime change, laws which encourage divorce and weaken families, flooding a city with immigrants to crash market prices, lawfare and prison for journalists and honest politicians, blackmail operations for vulnerable politicians and media influencers, election manipulation, assasionation, anything which makes people feel isolated from each other and separated from God.  
2. [Levin shows an example of one organism hijacking the morphogenesis of another organism.](https://youtu.be/7vsYIlukqn0?si=mC_nYKDYxDUoFILR&t=2216)  
3. [What does it look like when another other macro-organisms hijack Mac's morphogenesis?](https://x.com/MikeBenzCyber/status/1859468415070576815)  
4. [Who already knows where the controls are and is already using them to control Mac's behavior and to hijack Mac's morphogenesis?](https://x.com/JamesMelville/status/1602551782227558400)   
5. How can these controls be decentralized so that no central powers can decide the target morphogenesis for the human macro-organism of which we are all a part?  
6. [Levin explains cancer in an organism and demonstrates a cure.](https://youtu.be/lIHUWOv4nkE?si=yipnr8uxzCT6ohv3&t=2761)  
7. [What does cancer look like in Mac?](https://johnshearing.github.io/unseen_creatures_which_feed_on_humans/)  
8. ### How can the cure for cancer, which Levin has already discovered, be applied to the human macro-organism (Mac) and how can we help Mac reach its target form when no human knows what type of macro-organism Mac is trying to assemble itself into?
    * Both objectives are accomplished when everyone follows one simple rule.
    * Individual cells don't know what type of biological organism they are trying to build any more than we know what type of macro-organism we are trying to build.  
    * All the cells do is follow one simple rule, and the target organism results from the intelligence in the collective that no individual cell knows anything about. 
    * We humans do not need to know what type of macro-organism we are building any more than cells need to know what type of organism they are building.  
    * All we need to do is follow one simple rule and Mac will self-assemble into its preferred target form. 
    * This simple rule (written below) has been stated first in Jewish scripture and has been amplified by Jesus and Muhammad for clarity.
    * It may seem like two rules at first but it's just one rule given in two different ways so that we can understand it better.
    * We will be looking at this simple rule through the lens of Morphogenesis and the Price System provided by Levin and Lyons to see if this is the rule required to help Mac navigate the obstacles to reach it's preferred target state (heaven on earth for us) without our needing to know what that target state is.
    * > Matthew 22:36-40 King James Version, The Great Commandment
      > * Master, which is the great commandment in the law?
      > * Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy [soul](https://johnshearing.github.io/unseen_creatures_which_feed_on_humans/#What_Is_The_Soul), and with all thy mind.
      > * This is the first and great commandment.
      > * And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
      > * On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
      * This is not two great commandments, this is The One Great Commandment given in two different ways (And the second is like unto it).
      * It was given to us twice so that we would understand that loving the collective intelligence right next to us is how we love the greatest collective intelligence(God).
      * We love the entire collective (God) when we care for our neighbors.
      * We are told to love our neighbors **as** ourselves.
        * Not "like" ourselves but "as" ourselves - as if we can not distinguish between our neighbor's and ourselves.
        * In [The Parable Of The Good Samaritan](https://johnshearing.github.io/bible_passages_where_jesus_speaks/#Who_Is_My_Neighbor_And_What_Do_You_Mean_By_Love), Jesus brings even more clarity to The One Great Commandment. Jesus uses the word "compassion" to describe what The Good Samaritan was feeling for the injured man. The word "compassion" means to suffer with.
        * This is very similar to [what Levin describes in this video](https://youtu.be/sViUqqkuTkA?si=G5iRplqEkWeb7MIT&t=1399) and in [this video](https://youtu.be/YnObwxJZpZc?si=WPy16qbGLEu6D2uC&t=2456) where cells work together because their minds are electrically coupled together. The cells in our bodies truly cannot differentiate themselves from other cells. So when one cell is being stressed, the other cells think they are being stressed and so respond to help. Cells have true compassion for each other because they literally feel each other's pain.
        * Levin states that cells which are electrically coupled have a common identity which forces them to cooperate in achieving goals. Now think about how identity politics has been wielded by Deep State controlled media in recent elections and then consider how identity controls on collective intelligence scale from micro-organism to organism to macro-organism.  
        * This is also very similar to [what Lyons describes in this video](https://youtu.be/0Oo4ng6dWrQ?si=hre-3jXSljHzJpKY&t=890) where humans share each other's stress via the price system and so work together to find the best solution.
        #### Who Is My Neighbor? To Whom Do I Charge Interest? Mac's Morphogenesis (Humanity's Destiny) Hangs On This Question.
          * The [The Parable Of The Good Samaritan](https://johnshearing.github.io/bible_passages_where_jesus_speaks/#Who_Is_My_Neighbor_And_What_Do_You_Mean_By_Love) gives us another important insight about identity.
          * The lawyer asks Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?" In other words, "With whom do I identify with?" or "Who is also part of my body?" or "Who's pain besides my own do I feel?"
          * The Samaritans and the Jews had much animosity towards each other and these feelings were cultivated by the Romans in order to make both peoples easier to manage.
          * But Jesus tells of a Samaritan who feels compassion for an injured Jew and makes clear that we are to feel compassion and show mercy to anyone in need without any regard for group identity.
          * #### In the Old Testament, God directly commands Jews not to lend at interest to poor Jews nor to any foreigners.
            > Exodus 22:25 New International Version (God is speaking to Moses)
            > * If you lend money to one of my people among you who is needy, do not treat it like a business deal; charge no interest.
            > Leviticus 25:35-37 New International Version (God is speaking to Moses)
            > * If any of your fellow Israelites become poor and are unable to support themselves among you, help them as you would a foreigner and stranger, so they can continue to live among you.
            >  * Do not take interest or any profit from them, but fear your God, so that they may continue to live among you.
            >  * You must not lend them money at interest or sell them food at a profit.
          * #### Contrary to what God has instructed Moses to say, Moses allowed Jews to lend at interest to foreigners (Non-Jews) and forbad lending to any Jew.
            > Deuteronomy 23:19-20 King James Version (Moses is speaking to his people, the Jews)
            > * Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury:
            > * Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury: that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to possess it.
          * Lending at interests is arguably the greatest cause of human suffering and the cause of usury is a narrow scope of group identity. This fits Levin's definition of cancer at the scale of macro-organism.
          * In other words, humans only lend at interest to people they don't care about. This understanding is clearly documented all the way back to the time of Moses.  
          * Suffering Caused By The Central Banks:
            * [All Wars Are Bankers' Wars: Search X for 43 minute video](https://x.com/search?q=all%20wars%20are%20bankers%20wars&src=typed_query)

          * Levin shows that the underlying cause of cancer is a narrow scope of group identity.
          * The cancer of usury would be forbidden in Jewish law, except between wealthy Jews, if Moses had felt the same sense of identity (compassion) with all people that he felt for his own people (the Jewish people).
          * So there is a clear link between cancer at the scale of macro-organism and a narrow scope of group identity.
          * **This question of, "Who is my neighbor?", is a question that all people struggle with - not just Jews.**
          * **Jesus warned against usury but it is still practiced by Christians as much as it is by Jews.**
          * **The Parable of The Good Samaritan is in the Bible to remind Christians to care for all people not just other Christians**
          * **Usury is completely forbidden under Islamic law which indicates that Muslims have the widest scope of "neighbor" (the most compassion) in this category.**
          * **Usury is not evil, usury is cancer at the scale of macro-organism when the scope of "neighbor" is narrow**
          * **Levin's cure for cancer does not kill the cancer. Rather it widens the scope of "neighbor".**
          * **Usury and all the suffering it causes will disappear as humans widen the scope of "neighbor".**
          * **All forms of mind, market, and money manipulation will disappear as humans widen the scope of "neighbor".**
            
  ### The foundational questions we will be asking as we explore BioElectocracy are: 
  ### What form of governance most widens the scope of who each of us consider to be neighbors across all categories and demographics?
  ### What form of governance transmits local stresses globally to all communities and encourages all communities to take local action with solutions that scale in response. 
  ### Is it possible to share each other's stress without losing our own identities and our own agency?
  ### The Problem of Trust:
Short term stress such as exercise promotes a long, healthy, happy life.   
Long term stress such as living in chronic fear or rage causes poor health and early death.   
If Mac is to develop normally, then it must feel safe and be free of anxiety as it grows.  
That means that Mac's cells (that's us) must have a sense of trust for each other.   
But how can we feel compassion for neighbors that we fear and do not trust.  
Lack of trust may be the biggest obstacle to compassion and stress sharing and lack of trust is hurting Mac.  
This is by design.  
Although not has large as Mac, our **U.S. central bank controlled government** (USCBCG) is a macro-organism too, and it must feed.  
We know that the USCBCG spreads violence, famine, toxins, disease, fear, mistrust, and instability throughout the world and in the United States too in order to feed.    
It feeds by damaging Mac and devouring the broken parts.  

Christ tells us to love our enemies and that God will protect us.  
The USCBCG tells us to hate our enemies and that we are in constant danger.  
Which one is true?  
It's the one we think is true.  
Love and trust is the natural state of man.  
Hate and fear are instigated by the central bank controlled governments so that they can feed.  

Possible Solutions To The Trust Problem:  
1. How can Blockchain Technology (AKA Decentralized Trustless Technology) be used as a better price system so as to restore trust for all governments at the citizen level and a sense of peace for Mac so that it can grow normally, without becoming sick, psychotic, and eventually destroying itself?  
2. Can awareness and love for Mac at the citizen level be hardcoded into our new decentralized trustless blockchain price system?  
3. How can Levin and Lyons' work be used to show that Mac is a living person that deserves care in its own right and that our lives depend on providing care for Mac?

**Below are notes and links which will be woven into the narative started above.**  
I have no idea where this is all going.  
The following proverb will be my guide.  
> Proverbs 3:5-6 King James Version  
> * Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.
> * In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.
  * The above indicates that the intelligence, the competencies, and the plan are stored in the collective intelligence rather than in the individual and that the individual is to trust in the collective intelligence.
  * We are **not** being told to trust the collective intelligence which is Mac, but rather the collective intelligence that sits at the very top - the one made from all the smaller collective intelligences. This is God.
  * Many will ask how one can know what path God is asking us to follow. That's easy - it's the choice that feels most like love and kindness during prayer and meditation (when the mind is quiet). If none of your choices feel loving or kind then your mind is not quite enough. God will never send you a thought that doesn't feel loving and kind. Sit longer until your mind is quiet enough to hear what God is saying to you.

Interesting to note that the word Mina is found in "[The Parable of the Ten Minas](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2019%3A11-27&version=NIV)", Luke 19:11-27 New International Version   
This is not a lesson about using money to multiply money.  
This is a parable about using faith to multiply faith.  
The minas represent spiritual resources (faith, love for God, and love for each other).  
And people are expected to use these to create more faith, more love for God, and more love for each other.  
This is not for God's benefit, it's for our benefit.  
Near the end of the story, the king admonishes the servant who hid his mina rather than using it to create more wealth.  
"Why then didn’t you put my money on deposit, so that when I came back, I could have collected it with interest?" asked the king.  
Jesus is against lending at interest as we see in [Luke 6:34-35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%206%3A34-35&version=NIV).  
So you might wonder why he mentions interest in a positive light in The Parable of the Minas?  
It's because he is not really talking about money, he is talking about faith.  
Jesus wants us to know that when we lend our faith, it compounds with interest, but in a way that benefits everyone, not just the lender.  

Levin talks about gliders in the game of life.  
He says that gliders don't actually exist physically in the game but rather exist as patterns that we notice as the game proceeds.
Nevertheless when one recognizes that gliders patterns are real, then one can do useful things with them such as using the patterns to make a Turing complete computer with the the Game Of Life itself.


What is it that Mac is trying to assemble itself into. I think the answer is the best possible home (society?) for its cells (that would be us).  
My reason for thinking so is because that's what [the collective intelligence of the honey bee colony searches for](https://youtu.be/NDnQ4pAjBUg?t=310) with respect to its cells (the bees).  

Cell respond to expectation: [Similarity between Levin and Lipton](https://youtu.be/YnObwxJZpZc?si=5T98x273sgCt4Un-&t=3886), Hypnodermatology

[Levin's paper on relationship between zen and compassion](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/24/5/710)

[An advisory committee convened by FDA in June also raised concerns that MDMA's mind-altering effects made it nearly impossible to “blind” participants to whether they were getting drug or placebo.](https://www.science.org/content/article/fda-rejected-mdma-assisted-ptsd-therapy-other-psychedelics-firms-intend-avoid-fate#:~:text=An%20advisory%20committee%20convened%20by,therapies'%20benefits%20outweigh%20the%20risks.)  

While it is reasonable to consider Mac as single intelligent life form, our own lives depend on understanding that Mac is also a developing organ in a much larger being (our planetary ecosystem).

It has been said that information is a difference that makes a difference.  
In other words a change in one structure (A) causes a change in some other structure (B).  
Structure (B) must notice that structure (A) has changed, so a small transfer of energy from (A) To (B) must be required to move information but that is not all that is required.  
Stucture (B) must already be set to change its state as a result of the energy received by stucture (A).  
It might be said that structure (B) must be listening for, or at least be receptive to changes is structure (A).   
It's a relationship. There must be a relationship in place in order for information to be passed from (A) to (B).  
A line of dominos must be standing in order for the falling of domino (A) to affect the state of domino (B).  
So it might be said that domino (B) when standing, is listening, or watching for a change in domino (A).  
Perhaps it would be better to say that there is a relationship between domino (A) and domino (B) only when both are standing.  
Whether or not information is passed from domino (A) to (B) depends on a relationship already being in place between the two.  
If domino (B) is already laying down when domino (A) falls upon it then energy is being passed between the two but no information that we are interested in is passed.  
If domino (B) is standing when domino (A) falls upon it then both energy and information is passed because the state of domino (B) will change from standing to laying down.  
So underlying the passage of all information is relatioinship.  

Only a small change in the voltage on the base terminal of a transitor creates a large change in the amount of current flowing between the collector and emitter terminals.  

The problem of not wanting to change or resistance to change.  

There is no source of darkness.  


Choosing the path of least resistance.  

There seems to be a relationship between price equilibrium in ecconomics and impedance matching in electronics.  
In both systems, we're essentially dealing with the optimization of power or value transfer:  

Price Equilibrium:  
Market price settles where supply and demand curves intersect  
This point represents maximum economic efficiency  
Maximum number of mutually beneficial transactions occur  
Any deviation reduces the total economic value generated  


Impedance Matching:  
Occurs when source and load impedances are matched  
Results in maximum power transfer  
Any mismatch reduces power delivery efficiency  
The load receives optimal power from the source  

The key parallel is that both systems achieve maximum transfer (of value or power) when their respective "resistances" are matched:  
In markets, the "resistance" is the price sensitivity of buyers and sellers  
In electronics, it's the actual electrical impedance of components  

When mismatched:  
Markets experience deadweight loss (reduced transactions)  
Circuits experience power reflection and reduced transfer  


[The instructions for morphogenesis are not in the genes.](https://youtu.be/whZRH7IGAq0?si=XK6hkvzAPQ-dS9lL&t=1771)

What type of attractor is human governance?  
point attractors (a single stable point), limit cycle attractors (periodic oscillations), and strange attractors (complex, chaotic patterns) 

[All intelligence is collective intelligence](https://youtu.be/YnObwxJZpZc?si=lnnk7VqOBz-127Bz&t=1074).  
The sensation of feeling that I experience in my finger tips, for instance, is not a direct experience, but rather virtual experience assembled from many signals starting a with the cells in my fingers and then relayed along by other cells to the brain cells that process the signals to produce a result which my collective self (me) perceive as sensation in the finger tips. My collective self (me) and therefore all my experience is not physical, but rather just signals passing between my parts (the cells) which causes all the cells, as a collective (me), to respond in some way. That the group of cells (I) am conscious at all is simply because some of my cells retain a relational memory of these events. What is this price system and how do my cells make use of it to create me?

information is a living think. Levin says "Thoughts are thinkers."

About The Trinity 
Father - The mind. Infinite intelligence and love. Nonphysical. Made from the information exchanged in the universe.
Son - thats us, The body. The sensation. The raw input.
Holy Spirit, Our relationship. The nervous system. That which causes us to love The Father and which causes The Father to love us.

I am realizing that the human super-organism is using groups of humans to form organs such that humans are locked into performing a single function and have little or no capacity to change their lives or even move from their geographic location.
This is good for a few but not so good for others.
It's a lot like the cells in the body speciallizing. 
Is this what Mac wants or is Mac's morphogenesis being hijacked?

For instance Michael Levin shows that cancer occurs when a cell or group of cells loses the ability to communicate with neighbors (blocked ion channels). The cells then act like a single cell organisms rather than community members and so feed upon neighbors. This same kind of cancer seems to happen at the level of human society as well. When communication is blocked between communities, or when communities identify as different than other communities then they will all stop cooperating and start to feed upon the others. Benjamin Lyons makes this comparison intuitively accessible to us by asking to imagine why we react to stubbing our toe with greater concern than the death of a large group of people seen on a news cast. The fact that we can feel the pain of a stubbed toe, but the best we can do is imagine the suffering of people shown in a news cast. The toe is part of the self because it can share it's stress directly with the rest of our body where as the dying and injured on the news have no such direct connection with which to share their stress. 

Bioelectricity explains how an oak gall wasp can hack the bioelectric network in the leaf of an oak tree, hijacking its morphogenesis such that the leaf to grows into a gall which becomes a home for the wasp's offspring. 
I think we see the central banks, corporations, and supporting industrial complexes hacking humanity's morphogenesis. 
The body of work raises the question of what exactly is the target of morphogenesis for the human collective if allowed to develop without being hacked. 
Finally, I am wondering if it is possible to hardcode "Love thy neighbor as thyself" into a governance system as it appears to happen in bioelectric networks.  

[Video: Why Democracy Is Mathematically Impossible](https://youtu.be/qf7ws2DF-zk?si=brxyoh59HRFQK3Nf)  
The video pointed out that our current forms of democracy all resolve mathematically to dictatorship except for a rated voting system which can represent a democracy in the case of voting for a leader.
I picked out two false premises in the video.
1. That a voting system which leads to best collective decision must have [these 5 qualities]((https://youtu.be/qf7ws2DF-zk?si=MFM6N08a6Rbcnp0m&t=843):
[Bees collective decision making process](https://github.com/johnshearing/beemocracy/blob/main/BeemocracyMina.md) does not share these qualities.
Bees have a form of democracy which closely resembles governance by random juries which was not discussed in the video.
This governance has been a stable and reliable way to produce the best decisions for the last million years.
2. [That elections should be rational](https://youtu.be/qf7ws2DF-zk?si=51knDhw2CCuxmx2X&t=3):
Game Theory only predicts an outcome if all actors in the game are rational and act in their own best interest.
So if actors are rational then you can predict with certainty what they will do.
If you can predict what your opponent will do then you have enough information to game the system and produce any outcome you want.
Therefore a functional voting system must be irrational, unpredictable, and non-deterministic.
[Beemocracy](https://github.com/johnshearing/beemocracy/blob/main/BeemocracyMina.md) has these qualities.
Perhaps this is exactly why United States policy seems so crazy.
Leaders must appear irrational (insane) in order to obscure their preferences, self-interest, and rationality.
This is so other leaders will have a more difficult time predicting their actions using Game Theory maths.
Of course other nations with their own game theorists ignore the show and also create their own show of insanity in order to prevent being gamed.

Been wondering about the inteligence in evolution.  
Where does it come from.  
We marvel at the intelligence of a single cell as it navigates morphous space to reach it's target form.  
What if what we view as the evolution of man is really just morphegenesis of the human super-organism as it grows to it's target form.  
[Here](https://youtu.be/YnObwxJZpZc?si=XvWyS9msxJg3RV9k&t=1485), Levin expresses evolution as morphogenisis of a higher scaled intelligence with a longer life span than our own.  

Still, where is the target form image (the blueprint) that the human super-organism is reading?  
What is the target form that the human super-organsim is trying to reach?
Is it all just guided by aggrigated preference?
Are other super-organisms (Central Banks) hacking our collective morphogenesis?

Compare this [Abraham Hicks cartoon](https://youtu.be/Nb5yL7vkV9k?si=9wy7kgQxXMwLoBup&t=21) with Benjamin Lyon's ideas about cognitive glue.  

Do cells war with each other during morphogenesis? If not, why do countries war?  

It will be an interesting and fun challenge to ask these questions, communicate these ideas, and tell this story.

How is it that Levin and Lipton have found the same results but interpret them so differently?  

Does Levin give us a scientific foundation for understanding The Lord's Prayer?  
Levin himself may not see the connection but that doesn't mean that no connection exists.  
Polycomputing may explain the discrepency.  
> Luke 11:1-4 King James Version
> * And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.
> * And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.
> * Give us day by day our daily bread.
> * And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.

Of course we can't see God, he appears to us, not as a person, but in miracles.   
Think of it this way - our cells can't see us and yet we are obviously real. The only thing our cells could possibly observe about us as a whole is that their problems are continualy being solved even though no individual cell is responsible for the solution or even understands how the problems are solved. But most people are blind to these miracles even though God showers endless miracles upon each and every one of us in every moment, and many in direct response to our needs, wants, and asking.  
Jesus explained this to Philip as follows:
> John 14:8-11 King James Version
> * Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.
> * Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father?
> * Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.
> * Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.
