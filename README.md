# bioelectocracy
This is a place holder for work on human governance and collective decision making based on Michael Levin's work with bioelectricity and neural cellular automata.  
Writing and software development will start after a short period of orientation.  
The first document will be a running list of learning resources for bioelectricity and neural cellular automata so others can more easily get started.  
Next will be a description of the voting and governance software which is likely to run on the Mina recursive zero knowledge proof blockchain.  
Then a small experimental implementation will be developed.
